# Challenges Solution

This workshop follows a story, and you should not start a new chapter if you did not complete the purposed challenges
in the previous chapters. 

The workshop is completely open source and elaborated with great dedication and effort. So if you are taken
the workshop is due to you want to learn GraphQL. That's why I invite you to try to solve all the purposed challenges
by yourself.

On the other hand, you could be stuck in one of the chapters. Just in that case, you could checkout the solutions
for the challenges.
