# GraphQL: Objects

## Introduction

The GraphQL specification includes the following default scalar types: Int, Float, String, Boolean and ID. 
While this covers most of the use cases, often you need to support custom atomic data types (e.g. Date), 
or you want a version of an existing type that does some validation. To enable this, GraphQL allows you to 
define custom scalar types. Enumerations are similar to custom scalars, but their values can only be one 
of a pre-defined list of strings. 


The way to define new scalars or enums in the schema is shown below:

```graphql
scalar MyCustomScalar

enum Direction {
  NORTH
  EAST
  SOUTH
  WEST
}

type MyType {
    myAttribute: MyCustomScalar
    direction: Direction
    ...
}

```

Fields can take arguments as input. These can be used to customize the return value (eg, filtering search results).
This is known as **field argument**.

If you have a look at our schema.graphql you can find an example of usage of a field argument for attribute actors 
in type Movie. The total argument is used to define the max number of actors returned from the server.


## Code

### Resolvers


Let's imagine that we have an operation that returns a Employee type and this
type contains an attribute details of type SocialDetails whose information needs to be taken from an external API.
And this attribute won't be always required by the API consumers. Server should not
waste time on obtaining something that clients do not need.


**src/resolvers.js**
```js
export default {
    Person: {
        details: async ({personId}) => {
            return await getDetailsFromLinkedin(personId)
        },
    }
    
}
``` 

Now, image that SocialDetails can be taken from more than one social network
and we want to permit the consumers to decide which social network must be used.

**resources/graphql/schema.graphql.**
```graphl
enum Source{
    Linkedin
    Facebook
}
type Person {

  details(source:Source=Linkedin):SocialDetails
}

```
Our resolver would look like this example:

**src/resolvers.js**
```js
export default {
    Person: {
        details: async ({personId},{source}) => {
            if (source === 'Linkedin'){
                return await getDetailsFromLinkedin(personId)    
            }
            return await getDetailsFromFacebook(personId)
        },
    }
    
}
``` 

### Scalars

The library **graphql** provides us with  class **GraphQLScalarType**. We just need to create a new instance an add it
as a new resolver. An example of scalar type is shown below:

**src/scalars.js**
```js
import {GraphQLScalarType} from 'graphql';

var OddType = new GraphQLScalarType({
  name: 'Odd',
  serialize: oddValue,
  parseValue: oddValue,
  parseLiteral(ast) {
    if (ast.kind === Kind.INT) {
      return oddValue(parseInt(ast.value, 10));
    }
    return null;
  }
});

function oddValue(value) {
  return value % 2 === 1 ? value : null;
}
```

**src/resolvers.js**
```js
export default {
    Odd: OddType,
}
```

custom scalars with gaphql-js.



## Challenges

1. Define an enum type Genre whose values are Drama and SciFi (add as many other as you want) and use it
for attribute genre in type Movie and  MovieRequest.

Run this query to verify your implementation works as expected

```graphql
mutation {
  addMovie (request:{
    title: "Corpse Bride"
    year: 2005
    budget: 35000000
    directorId: 1
    genre: SciFi
    thriller: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5qOjhD8j08"
  }){
    id
    director{
      fullName
      country
    }
    genre
  }
}
```


2. Define an enum Gender and use it for attribute gender in type Actor.

Run this query to verify your implementation works as expected

```graphql
query {
  listActors{
    fullName
    gender
  }
}
```

3. Define a scalar type Url and use it in attribute thriller of Movie and MovieRequest. Only valid
url's should be permitted.

This code could be useful for validate the url's

```js
export const validateUrl = (str) => {
    let pattern = new RegExp('^(https?:\\/\\/)' + // protocol
        '((([a-z\\d]([a-z\\d-]*[a-z\\d])*)\\.?)+[a-z]{2,}|' + // domain name
        '((\\d{1,3}\\.){3}\\d{1,3}))' + // OR ip (v4) address
        '(\\:\\d+)?(\\/[-a-z\\d%_.~+]*)*' + // port and path
        '(\\?[;&a-z\\d%_.~+=-]*)?' + // query string
        '(\\#[-a-z\\d_]*)?$', 'i'); // fragment locator
    return pattern.test(str);
}
```


Run this query to verify that only valid url's are permitted. Actually,
the movie should not be saved into the database.

```graphql
mutation {
  addMovie (request:{
    title: "Gran Torino"
    year: 2009
    budget: 28000000
    directorId: 6
    genre: Drama
    thriller: ".http"
  }){
    id
    director{
      fullName
      country
    }
    genre
    thriller
  }
}
```

Run this query to verify that your scalar Url works as expected.

```graphql
mutation {
  addMovie (request:{
    title: "Gran Torino"
    year: 2009
    budget: 28000000
    directorId: 6
    genre: Drama
    thriller: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ecW-d-CBPc"
  }){
    id
    director{
      fullName
      country
    }
    genre
    thriller
  }
}
```


4. Define an enum type Currency whose possible values are Euro and Dollar. Our API must permit
the API consumers to decide in which currency they want to obtain attribute budget in type Movie.
**1â‚¬ => 1.14$**


Run this query 

```graphql
query {
  getMovie(movieId:1){
    budgetInEuros: budget(currency:Euro)
    budgetInDollars: budget(currency:Dollar)
  }
}
```

and verify that the output should be this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getMovie": {
      "budgetInEuros": 20,
      "budgetInDollars": 22.799999999999997
    }
  }
}
```
