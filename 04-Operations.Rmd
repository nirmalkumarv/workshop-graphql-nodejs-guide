# GraphQL: Operations

## Introduction

GraphQL provides us 3 different operations:

- **Queries**: Operation to retrieve data from the server.
- **Mutations**: CUD operations: Create, Update and Delete.
- **Subscriptions**: Create and maintain real time connection to the server. 
This enables the client to get immediate information about related events. Basically, a client 
subscribes to an event in the server, and whenever that event ocurrs, the server sends data to the client. 

In our workshop.graphql we will find already implemented operations.

## Code

Actually there's not difference between implement a query or a mutation. We will just implament a function that 
can retrieve 4 arguments:

- **parent**: The result of the previous resolver call.
- **args**: The arguments of the resolverâ€™s field.
- **context**: A custom object each resolver can read from/write to.
- **info**: It contains the query AST and more execution information. 

**queries.js**
```js

export const myQuery = (parentValue, args, ctx,info) => {
    return {
        
    }
};
```

**mutations.js**
```js
export const myMutation = (parentValue, args, ctx, info) => {
    return {
              
    }
};
``` 

Subscriptions looks a little bit different because we need to register to an event.

**subscriptions.js**
```js
export const listenChangesInTeam = {
    subscribe: (
        (_, {teamId}) => {
            return pubsub.asyncIterator(`teams.${teamId}`);
        }
    ),
    resolve: (payload, args, context, info) => {
        return payload;
    }
}
```

## Challenges

1. Implement operations **addActor** and **deleteActor**.
2. Implement operation **rateMovie** that retrieves a new Input type MovieRateRequest. 
MovieRateRequest contains the movieID, the user email and the score. The operation will
persist data into table **movies_rates** and will return the Movie.
3. Modify type Movie and add a new attribute rate whose value is the average score for 
all the given rates.
4. Modify operation addMovie. Add a new attribute actorsId (array with the id's of the actors).
5. Define a new query **getMovieRate** that retrieves an argument movieId and the output
type is MovieRate. The output must look like this:

```json
{
  "rate": "7",
  "rates": [
    {
      "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
      "score": 8
    },
    {
      "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
      "score": 6
    },
  ]
}
```

5. Create a new subscription **listenRates**. This operation retrieves an argument movieId
and It displays the new rates for the given movieId.
