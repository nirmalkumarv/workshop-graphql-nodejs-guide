# GraphQL: Operations

## Introduction

GraphQL provides us 3 different operations:

- **Queries**: Operation to retrieve data from the server.
- **Mutations**: CUD operations: Create, Update and Delete.
- **Subscriptions**: Create and maintain real time connection to the server. 
This enables the client to get immediate information about related events. Basically, a client 
subscribes to an event in the server, and whenever that event ocurrs, the server sends data to the client. 

In our workshop.graphqls we will find already implemented operations.

## Code

The only difference between implementing a mutation and a query is that methods for  mutations 
are in a class that implements GraphQLMutationResolver and for queries in a class that 
implements GraphQLQueryResolver. 

**QueryResolver.java**
```java
@Component
public class QueryResolver implements GraphQLQueryResolver {
    
    public List<Monkeys> listMonkeys(DataFetchingEnvironment env) {
        return monkeyService
            .listMonkeys()
            .stream()
            .map(monkeyModelToMonkey::convert)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
        
    public Movie getMonkey(Integer monkeyId,DataFetchingEnvironment env) {
        MovieEntity entity = monkeyService.findMonkeyById(monkeyId);
        return monkeyModelToMonkey.convert(entity);
    }
        
}
```

**MutationResolver.java**
```java
@Component
public class MutationResolver implements GraphQLMutationResolver {
     public Monkey addMonkey(MonkeyRequest request,DataFetchingEnvironment env) {
        try {
            MonkeyModel entity = monkeyRequestToMonkeyModel.convert(request);
            entity = monkeyService.addMonkey(entity);
            return monkeyModelToMonkey.convert(entity);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            throw ex;
        }
    }
}
``` 

Subscriptions looks a little bit different because we need to subscribe to an event.
The methods must be defined in a class that implements GraphQLSubscriptionResolver.


**SubscriptionResolver.java**
```java
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@Component
public class SubscriptionResolver implements GraphQLSubscriptionResolver {
 
    public Publisher<Monkey> checkNewMonekys() {
        return monkeysPublisher.getPublisher();
    }
        
}
```

## Challenges

1. Implement operations **addActor** and **deleteActor**.
2. Implement operation **rateMovie** that retrieves a new Input type MovieRateRequest. 
MovieRateRequest contains the movieID, the user email and the score. The operation will
persist data into table **movies_rates** and will return the Movie.
3. Modify type Movie and add a new attribute rate whose value is the average score for 
all the given rates.
4. Modify operation addMovie. Add a new attribute actorsId (array with the id's of the actors).
4. Define a new query **getMovieRate** that retrieves an argument movieId and the output
type is MovieRate. The output must look like this:

```json
{
  "rate": "7",
  "rates": [
    {
      "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
      "score": 8
    },
    {
      "email": "john.doe@mail.com",
      "score": 6
    },
  ]
}
```

5. Create a new subscription **listenRates**. This operation retrieves an argument movieId
and It displays the new rates for the given movieId.
