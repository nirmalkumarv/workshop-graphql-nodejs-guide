# Set up your environment

## Download the project

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesovilabs-workshops/workshop-graphql-nodejs.git
cd workshop-graphql-nodejs
```

## Project organization


> Project follows the guidelines for structuring a NodeJS project

In this project you will find two separated directories:

### Javascript code

- **src**: It contains the source code for the application


### Docker and configuration files

- **resources/graphql**: It contains the GraphQL schema implemented by the API.

- **resources/docker-compose**: It contains the docker-compose descriptor and the containers configuration files.

- **resources/local**: It contains default configuration file that will be used when running the server locally.. 

## Running the server

From the root directory you just need to execute

```bash
make deploy
``` 

or in case of you don't have make command installed 


```bash
docker build -t=wesovilabs/workshop-graphql-nodejs:local .;
docker-compose -f resources/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml run --rm -p9001:9001 api
```

To clean the launched containers you just need to perform

```bash
make docker-stop
```

or 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

### While you're coding

The above commands launch the full environment: database and API. On the other hand,
when we're coding we could rather launch the database from the docker-compose and the 
API from our local machine.

1. Launching database container from docker-compose

```bash
make database
```

or 

```bash
docker-compose -f src/main/resources/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml run --rm -p5456:5432 database
```

2. Run the application from your IDE or by command line

```bash
npm install;
APP_CONFIG_PATH=./resources/local/config.json NODE_ENV=local npm start;
```

## The application

### Database 

![Workshop database model](assets/database-model.png)

Databases will be populated with below data when postgres container is launched.

### API

By defualt the below operations are already implemented in our project.

#### Queries

- **listDirectors:[Director!]**: It returns the list of directors.
- **listActors:[Actor!]**:It returns the list of actors.
- **listMovies:[Movie!]**: It returns the list of movies.
- **getMovie(movieId:ID!):Movie**: It returns the movie with given id.

#### Mutations

- **addMovie(request:MovieRequest):Movie!**: It adds a new movie.
- **addActor(request:ActorRequest):Actor!**: It adds a new actor. 
- **deleteActor("Identifier of the actor" actorId:ID!):[Actor!]**: It 
deletes the actor with the given id.

#### Subscriptions

- **listenDirectorMovies(directorId:ID!):Movie!**: It open a communication with 
the server and It is notified when a new movie is created for the directorId in the request.


### GraphQL schema

The full GraphQL schema looks

```graphql
schema {
    # The query root of Workshop GraphQL interface.
    query: Query
    # The root query for implementing GraphQL mutations.
    mutation: Mutation
    # The root query for implementing GraphQL subscriptions.
    subscription: Subscription

}
