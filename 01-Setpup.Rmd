# Set up your environment

## Download the project

The workshop can be followed in: NodeJS. (Java, Python, Go are coming soon).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesovilabs-workshops/workshop-graphql-java.git
cd workshop-graphql-java
```

## Project organization


> Project follows the guidelines for structuring a Java project with Gradle. 

 
### ./src/main/java

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.domain**: It contains the classes that represent
the GraphQL domain model. 

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.database**: This package contains two sub-packages
model and repository. The first onw contains the database model and the second one
the DAO layer.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.converter**: This package contains classes
that will help in order to make transformation between objects. Basically for 
transforming the GraphQL domain objects into entities that will be persisted
into the database.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.publisher**: Pub-sub implementations that will be used
by subscription operations.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.resolver**: It contains the resolver for our application: 
queries, mutations and subscriptions but also the resolver of the output types when it is required.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.service**: This is the business layer which is 
call from the resolver package and It delegates the request to the repository.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.directive**: Empty package that will be used during the workshop.

- **com.wesovilabs.workshops.graphql.scalae**: Empty package that will be used during the workshop.


### ./src/main/resources

- **workshop.graphqls**: GraphQL schema that is implemented by our application.

- **application.yaml**: Default configuration file used by spring-boot when running the application locally.

- **docker/Dockerfile**: Docker descriptor for out application.

- **docker-compose/docker-compose.yml**: Descriptor for launching bot database and our application.

- **docker-compose/api**: Configuration files used by api container.

- **docker-compose/postgres**: Configuration files used by postgres container.

## Running the server

From the root directory you just need to execute

```bash
make deploy
``` 

or in case of you don't have make command installed 


```bash
gradle build;
docker build -f src/main/resources/docker/Dockerfile -t=wesovilabs/workshop-graphql-java:local .;
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -run -p9001:9001 api
```

To clean the launched containers you just need to perform

```bash
make docker-stop
```

or 

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

## The application

### Database 

![Workshop database model](assets/database-model.png)

Databases will be populated with below data when postgres container is launched.

### API

By defualt the below operations are already implemented in our project.

#### Queries

- **listDirectors:[Director!]**: It returns the list of directors.
- **listActors:[Actor!]**:It returns the list of actors.
- **listMovies:[Movie!]**: It returns the list of movies.
- **getMovie(movieId:ID!):Movie**: It returns the movie with given id.

#### Mutations

- **addMovie(request:MovieRequest):Movie!**: It adds a new movie.
- **addActor(request:ActorRequest):Actor!**: It adds a new actor. 
- **deleteActor("Identifier of the actor" actorId:ID!):[Actor!]**: It 
deletes the actor with the given id.

#### Subscriptions

- **listenDirectorMovies(directorId:ID!):Movie!**: It open a communication with 
the server and It is notified when a new movie is created for the directorId in the request.


### GraphQL schema

The full GraphQL schema looks

```graphql
schema {
    # The query root of Workshop GraphQL interface.
    query: Query
    # The root query for implementing GraphQL mutations.
    mutation: Mutation
    # The root query for implementing GraphQL subscriptions.
    subscription: Subscription

}
