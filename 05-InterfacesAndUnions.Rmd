# GraphQL: Interfaces and Unions

## Introduction

An interface exposes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface. 

**schema.graphql**
```graphql
interface Restaurant {
    id:ID!
    name: String!
}

type Indian implements Restaurant{
    id:ID!
    name: String!
    brewedBeer:Boolean!
}

type Burger implements Restaurant{
    id:ID!
    name: String!
    vegetarianOptions: Boolean!
}

type Query{
    listRestaurants: [Restaurant!]
}

```

Unions are identical to interfaces, except that they don't define a common set of fields. Unions are generally preferred 
over interfaces when the possible types do not share a logical hierarchy.

```graphql
union Item = Food | Electronic | Customer

type Electronic {
    size: Float
    weight: Float
}

type Food {
    family: String
}

type Customer {
    fullName: String
    zip: String
}
type Query{
    listItems: [Item!]
}
 
```

## Fragments

Fragments are powerful technique when we are consuming a query that returns an Interface or an Union. They are used to define
what attributes we want to obtain from the server depending on the type of the concrete element.

```graphql
query {
    listRestaurants:{
        id
        name
        ... on Indian {
            brewedBeer
        }
        ... on Burger {
            vegetarianOptions
        }
        __typename
    }
}  

```

## Code

To implement a new operation with interfaces or unions is easy. We just need to do it as we did in the previous chapter
[GraphQL: Operations](#GraphQL:-Operations)

On the other hand, we need to define new resolvers to make the server understand which kind of inherited type it
must return. Below we can find a real example: 

**resolvers.js**
```graphql
export default {
    Url: Url,
    Query:{
    
    },
    Mutation: {
    
    },
    Restaurant: {
        __resolveType(restaurant, context, info){
            if(restaurant.brewedBeer){
                return 'Indian';
            }
            return 'Burger'
        },
    }
    ...
}
```

## Challenges

- Define an interface Person with commons attributes for Actor and Director. Add  a new query
listPeople that returns a list of people ([Person!]).
- Define an union named Item that could be a Movie or an Actor. Add an operations listItems that return
the full list of Items. [Item!]
