# The GraphQL Playground

## Introduction

Once the server is up and ready we can interact with our API by making use of the **GraphQL Playground**. There are
several desktop applications that allow us to run our queries against GraphQL API's. On the other hand, to follow the
workshop we will make use of an embedded web client which is deployed within out api.

Just open [ohttp://localhost:9001/graphql](http://localhost:9001/graphql) in your browser.

Learn to use ir is not rock science at all. Queries are written on the left side and the result of these is displayed on the right one. 

Headers can be entered  by clicking the **HTTP Headers** button on the bottom.

To check the **API documentation** we just need to click on the green button on the right (SCHEMA) and a handy  menu will
be shown.

## GraphQL syntax

On the below picture we can observe how queries, mutations and subscriptions are made from the Graphiql. Beer in mind
that you can only run one of these three operations at time. On the other hand you can perform several queries or several mutations
at time. Have a look at the examples to understand how queries can be executed.

## Challenges

1. Write a query that returns the below details (**getMovie**)

- How many actors are shown?

- Are the returned fields the same that appear in the picture?


2. Create a new director (**addDirector**)
3. Subscript to the movies for the created director in the previous step. (**listenDirectorMovies**)
3. Open another tab in your GraphQL Playground and add a new movie in which the director is the one that you just created. (**addMovie**). 
4. Verify that new movie has been notified to the subscription that we launched in step 3.
