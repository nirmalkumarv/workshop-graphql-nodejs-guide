Just open ohttp://localhost:9001/graphql in your browser. GraphQL playground Queries are written on the left side and the response of these are displayed on the right one. To check the API documentation we just need to click on the green button on the right (SCHEMA) and a handy menu will be shown. 3.2 GraphQL syntax GraphQL operations are: queries, mutations and subscriptions. We can run only one operation per request. On the other hand we can send more than a query or more than a mutation at time. Queries with alias Mutations Subscriptions 3.3 Challenges Write a query that returns the below details (getMovie) for movie with id 1. Edward Scissorhands How many actors are returned from the server? Are the returned fields the same ones that appear in the picture? Create a new director (addDirector) Subscript to the movies for the created director in the previous step.

["graphql-objects.html", "Chapter 4 GraphQL: Objects 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Code 4.3 Challenges", " Chapter 4 GraphQL: Objects 4.1 Introduction The GraphQL specification includes the following default scalar types: Int, Float, String, Boolean and ID. While this covers most of the use cases, often you need to support custom atomic data types (e.g. Date), or you want a version of an existing type that does some validation. To enable this, GraphQL allows you to define custom scalar types. Enumerations are similar to custom scalars, but their values can only be one of a pre-defined list of strings. The way to define new scalars or enums in the schema is shown below: scalar MyCustomScalar enum Direction { NORTH EAST SOUTH WEST } type MyType { myAttribute: MyCustomScalar direction: Direction ... } Fields can take arguments as input. These can be used to customize the return value (eg, filtering search results). This is known as field argument. If you have a look at our schema.graphql you can find an example of usage of a field argument for attribute actors in type Movie. The total argument is used to define the max number of actors returned from the server. 4.2 Code 4.2.1 Resolvers Let’s imagine that we have an operation that returns a Employee type and this type contains an attribute details of type SocialDetails whose information needs to be taken from an external API. And this attribute won’t be always required by the API consumers. Server should not waste time on obtaining something that clients do not need. src/resolvers.js export default { Person: { details: async ({personId}) =&gt; { return await getDetailsFromLinkedin(personId) }, } } Now, image that SocialDetails can be taken from more than one social network and we want to permit the consumers to decide which social network must be used. resources/graphql/schema.graphql. enum Source{ Linkedin Facebook } type Person { details(source:Source=Linkedin):SocialDetails } Our resolver would look like this example: src/resolvers.js export default { Person: { details: async ({personId},{source}) =&gt; { if (source === &#39;Linkedin&#39;){ return await getDetailsFromLinkedin(personId) } return await getDetailsFromFacebook(personId) }, } } 4.2.2 Scalars The library graphql provides us with class GraphQLScalarType. We just need to create a new instance an add it as a new resolver. An example of scalar type is shown below: src/scalars.js import {GraphQLScalarType} from &#39;graphql&#39;; var OddType = new GraphQLScalarType({ name: &#39;Odd&#39;, serialize: oddValue, parseValue: oddValue, parseLiteral(ast) { if (ast.kind === Kind.INT) { return oddValue(parseInt(ast.value, 10)); } return null; } }); function oddValue(value) { return value % 2 === 1 ? value : null; } src/resolvers.js export default { Odd: OddType, } Have a look here to learn more about how to implement custom scalars with gaphql-js. 4.3 Challenges Define an enum type Genre whose values are Drama and SciFi (add as many other as you want) and use it for attribute genre in type Movie and MovieRequest. Run this query to verify your implementation works as expected mutation { addMovie (request:{ title: &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; year: 2005 budget: 35000000 directorId: 1 genre: SciFi thriller: &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5qOjhD8j08&quot; }){ id director{ fullName country } genre } } Define an enum Gender and use it for attribute gender in type Actor. Run this query to verify your implementation works as expected query { listActors{ fullName gender } } Define a scalar type Url and use it in attribute thriller of Movie and MovieRequest. Only valid url’s should be permitted. This code could be useful for validate the url’s export const validateUrl = (str) =&gt; { let pattern = new RegExp(&#39;^(https?:\\\\/\\\\/)&#39; + // protocol &#39;((([a-z\\\\d]([a-z\\\\d-]*[a-z\\\\d])*)\\\\.?)+[a-z]{2,}|&#39; + // domain name &#39;((\\\\d{1,3}\\\\.){3}\\\\d{1,3}))&#39; + // OR ip (v4) address &#39;(\\\\:\\\\d+)?(\\\\/[-a-z\\\\d%_.~+]*)*&#39; + // port and path &#39;(\\\\?[;&amp;a-z\\\\d%_.~+=-]*)?&#39; + // query string &#39;(\\\\#[-a-z\\\\d_]*)?$&#39;, &#39;i&#39;); // fragment locator return pattern.test(str); } Run this query to verify that only valid url’s are permitted. Actually, the movie should not be saved into the database. mutation { addMovie (request:{ title: &quot;Gran Torino&quot; year: 2009 budget: 28000000 directorId: 6 genre: Drama thriller: &quot;.http&quot; }){ id director{ fullName country } genre thriller } } Run this query to verify that your scalar Url works as expected. mutation { addMovie (request:{ title: &quot;Gran Torino&quot; year: 2009 budget: 28000000 directorId: 6 genre: Drama thriller: &quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ecW-d-CBPc&quot; }){ id director{ fullName country } genre thriller } } Define an enum type Currency whose possible values are Euro and Dollar. Our API must permit the API consumers to decide in which currency they want to obtain attribute budget in type Movie. 1€ =&gt; 1.14$ Run this query query { getMovie(movieId:1){ budgetInEuros: budget(currency:Euro) budgetInDollars: budget(currency:Dollar) } } and verify that the output should be this: { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;getMovie&quot;: { &quot;budgetInEuros&quot;: 20, &quot;budgetInDollars&quot;: 22.799999999999997 } } } "],
["graphql-operations.html", "Chapter 5 GraphQL: Operations 5.1 Introduction 5.2 Code 5.3 Challenges", " Chapter 5 GraphQL: Operations 5.1 Introduction GraphQL provides us 3 different operations: Queries: Operation to retrieve data from the server. Mutations: CUD operations: Create, Update and Delete. Subscriptions: Create and maintain real time connection to the server. This enables the client to get immediate information about related events. Basically, a client subscribes to an event in the server, and whenever that event ocurrs, the server sends data to the client. In our workshop.graphql we will find already implemented operations. 5.2 Code Actually there’s not difference between implement a query or a mutation. We will just implament a function that can retrieve 4 arguments: parent: The result of the previous resolver call. args: The arguments of the resolver’s field. context: A custom object each resolver can read from/write to. info: It contains the query AST and more execution information. src/queries.js export const myQuery = (parentValue, args, ctx,info) =&gt; { return { } }; src/mutations.js export const myMutation = (parentValue, args, ctx, info) =&gt; { return { } }; Subscriptions looks a little bit different because we need to register to an event. src/subscriptions.js export const listenChangesInTeam = { subscribe: ( (_, {teamId}) =&gt; { return pubsub.asyncIterator(`teams.${teamId}`); } ), resolve: (payload, args, context, info) =&gt; { return payload; } } Have a look at already implemented queries,mutations and subscriptions in this project. 5.3 Challenges Implement operations addActor and deleteActor. Run these queries to verify they work as expected. mutation { addActor(request:{ fullName: &quot;Penelope Cruz&quot; gender:female country:&quot;Spain&quot; }){ id } } mutation { deleteActor(actorId:7){ id fullName } } Implement operation rateMovie that retrieves a new Input type MovieRateRequest. MovieRateRequest contains the movieID, the user email and the score. The operation will persist data into table movies_rates and will return the Movie. (Email must be a new scalar type) input MovieRateRequest { movieId:ID! email:Email! score:Int! } type Mutation { ... rateMovie(request:MovieRateRequest!):Movie! ... } Run this query to verify it works as expected mutation { rateMovie(request:{ movieId:1 email: &quot;thisisme@mail.com&quot; score: 8 }){ title } } Modify type Movie and add a new attribute rate whose value is the average score for all the given rates. mutation { rateMovie(request:{ movieId:1 email: &quot;thisisme2@mail.com&quot; score: 6 }){ title rate } } The returned attribute rate must be the average. Modify operation addMovie. Add a new attribute actorsId (array with the id’s of the actors). Run this query mutation { addMovie(request:{ title: &quot;The Irishman&quot; year: 2019 budget:130 genre: Action actorsId: [5,6] directorId: 4 }){ director{ fullName } actors(total:5){ id fullName } } } and the output should be { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;addMovie&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Irishman&quot;, &quot;director&quot;: { &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Martin Scorsese&quot; }, &quot;actors&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Al Pacino&quot; }, { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;6&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Robert de Niro&quot; } ] } } } Define a new query getMovieRate that retrieves an argument movieId and the output type is MovieRate. Run this query query{ getMovieRate(movieId:1){ rate rates{ email score } } } and the output should look similar to this: { &quot;rate&quot;: &quot;7&quot;, &quot;rates&quot;: [ { &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john.doe@mail.com&quot;, &quot;score&quot;: 8 }, { &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john.doe@mail.com&quot;, &quot;score&quot;: 6 } ] } Create a new subscription listenRates. This operation retrieves an argument movieId and It displays the new rates for the given movieId. From one tab we run the subscription subscription{ listenRates(movieId:1){ title rate } } and then we add a new rate for movie with identifier 1 mutation{ rateMovie(request:{ movieId: 1 email:&quot;yo@mail2.com&quot; score:3 }){ director{ id fullName } } } The subscription should print the details for movie with id 1 "],
["graphql-interfaces-and-unions.html", "Chapter 6 GraphQL: Interfaces and Unions 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Fragments 6.3 Code 6.4 Challenges", " Chapter 6 GraphQL: Interfaces and Unions 6.1 Introduction An interface exposes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface. schema.graphql interface Restaurant { id:ID! name: String! } type Indian implements Restaurant{ id:ID! name: String! brewedBeer:Boolean! } type Burger implements Restaurant{ id:ID! name: String! vegetarianOptions: Boolean! } type Query{ listRestaurants: [Restaurant!] } Unions are identical to interfaces, except that they don’t define a common set of fields. Unions are generally preferred over interfaces when the possible types do not share a logical hierarchy. union Item = Food | Electronic | Customer type Electronic { size: Float weight: Float } type Food { family: String } type Customer { fullName: String zip: String } type Query{ listItems: [Item!] } 6.2 Fragments Fragments are powerful technique when we are consuming a query that returns an Interface or an Union. They are used to define what attributes we want to obtain from the server depending on the type of the concrete element. query { listRestaurants:{ id name ... on Indian { brewedBeer } ... on Burger { vegetarianOptions } __typename } } 6.3 Code To implement a new operation with interfaces or unions is easy. We just need to do it as we did in the previous chapter GraphQL: Operations On the other hand, we need to define new resolvers to make the server understand which kind of inherited type it must return. Below we can find a real example: resolvers.js export default { Url: Url, Query:{ }, Mutation: { }, Restaurant: { __resolveType(restaurant, context, info){ if(restaurant.brewedBeer){ return &#39;Indian&#39;; } return &#39;Burger&#39; }, } ... } 6.4 Challenges Define an interface Person with commons attributes for Actor and Director. Add a new query listPeople that returns a list of people ([Person!]). query{ listPeople:[Person!] } Once you’ve implemented this query make use of fragments to return the below details { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;listPeople&quot;: [ { &quot;__typename&quot;: &quot;Actor&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Johnny Depp&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;female&quot; }, ... { &quot;__typename&quot;: &quot;Director&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Steven Spielberg&quot;, &quot;country&quot;: &quot;USA&quot; } ... ] } } Define an union named Item that could be a Movie or an Actor. Add an operations listItems that return the full list of Items. [Item!] query{ listItems:[Item!] } Once you’ve implemented this query make use of fragments to return the below details { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;listItems&quot;: [ { &quot;__typename&quot;: &quot;Movie&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; }, { &quot;__typename&quot;: &quot;Actor&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Russell Crowe&quot; } ... ] } } "],
["graphql-directives.html", "Chapter 7 GraphQL: Directives 7.1 Introduction 7.2 Code 7.3 Challenges", " Chapter 7 GraphQL: Directives 7.1 Introduction A GraphQL schema describes directives which are used to annotate various parts of a GraphQL document as an indicator that they should be evaluated differently by a validator, executor, or client tool such as a code generator. GraphQL implementations should provide the @skip and @include directives. GraphQL implementations that support the type system definition language must provide the @deprecated directive if representing deprecated portions of the schema. Directives must only be used in the locations they are declared to belong in. In this example, a directive is defined which can be used to annotate a field: facebook.github.io/graphql Authorization is a good and common scenario in which we usually will make use of directives. We could control what users are allowd to fetch an object (or even an attribute) from the server. directive @isAuthenticated on FIELD | FIELD_DEFINITION directive @hasRole(role: String) on FIELD | FIELD_DEFINITION or for clients tools as It was mentioned on the above paragraph. directive @deprecated( reason: String = &quot;No longer supported&quot; ) on FIELD_DEFINITION | ENUM_VALUE type ExampleType { newField: String oldField: String @deprecated(reason: &quot;Use `newField`.&quot;) } 7.2 Code When defining a directive we need to define its scope. Have a look at apollographql.com to understand how to implement our own directives. Below a very basic example of directive. directives.js import { SchemaDirectiveVisitor } from &quot;graphql-tools&quot;; class DeprecatedDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor { visitFieldDefinition(field) { field.isDeprecated = true; field.deprecationReason = this.args.reason; } visitEnumValue(value) { value.isDeprecated = true; value.deprecationReason = this.args.reason; } } Once we’ve implemented the directive , we just need to add the directives as shown below: src/schema.js export default makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers, schemaDirectives: { dreprecated: DeprecatedDirective, }, ... }); 7.3 Challenges Create a directive @uppercase that can be assigned to fields. This directive will transform the value of the attribute into uppercase. The directive declaration will look lie this directive @uppercase on FIELD_DEFINITION &quot;&quot;&quot;Movie details&quot;&quot;&quot; type Movie { ... title: String! @uppercase ... } To verify the directive was implemented correctly we can run query { listMovies{ title } } and check that the title for all the movies was returned in uppercase. { &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;listMovies&quot;: [ { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;EDWARD SCISSORHANDS&quot; }, { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;GLADIATOR&quot; } ] } } "],
